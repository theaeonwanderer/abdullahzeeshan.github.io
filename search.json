    "text": "Remember the first time you gazed through the night sky filled with twinkling stars? Perhaps, you were a little child lying on your Dadi’s lap, listening to lovely stories as you gazed your way through the abyss. Or perhaps it was the time when you gazed outside the car window as your Papa drove swiftly on the road.\n Photo by Vincentiu Solomon on Unsplash\nRemember the first time you rode your bicycle? The feelings that you felt- feelings of excitement, alertness, nervousness, and especially the feeling when you felt you got it as you peddled your way through the road shouting Yoohooooo!!\n Photo by Flo Karr on Unsplash\nThere is something magical about our first times. First time doing or experiencing something.\nThis is my first time blogging! Amongst the plethora of feelings that I am feeling right now, are nervousness and excitement. Nervous because I do not know what to write and I do not know how this would all turn up in the end. Excited because I think this can be the start of something great!\nI opened this draft, had a sip of tea, placed my hands on the keyboard, and thought about what to write. Then all of this sort of came naturally to me. Lucky me!\nI guess Khaled Hosseini was right when he said that he would sit at his writing desk and wish for something magical to happen!\nThe first time I realized that I had a knack for writing(or maybe I don’t) was when I was in high school, in 10th grade. There was this English test that had a letter-writing section, and if I remember correctly the theme was something around “Write a letter to the MLA about helping orphans”. One thing I clearly remember about writing that letter, although it was for a test, was that I captured the pain and emotions of orphans and poured it out. For me, it felt real. I even thought of writing an actual letter later and sending it to my local MLA to help out the orphans in my locality. Anyways, after we handed over our test papers, I got feedback from my English teacher who was amazed by what I wrote. She was impressed by my writing style and the depth of my clarity. That sort of stayed with me. I never got a chance to actually write something meaningful for the next some years until I entered college. During those years, I used to volunteer at an NGO on Sundays as an education volunteer teaching kids from slum areas Math & English. During one of those times, I had written a post that captured the feelings of those kids when we the volunteers would come and meet them every Sunday. I wrote it and shared it with my co-volunteers. They all loved it! That is when I got a sense of self-awareness that there is a writer that is hidden inside me.\nI am starting this blog platform to allow myself to be that writer. I do not wish to get fame or anything, but I just want to write my heart out!\nOne of the things that scare me to hell is when I die and I am in my grave, my tombstone shouldn’t say “A writer buried with his words”.\nSo this is the beginning of my journey to do something that I love, to do something that makes me happy, to do something that makes me feel at home, to do something for the sake of its beauty, to do something for the sake of my passion- to write! And I invite you as well my friend, to start doing what your heart has been saying to you for all these years.\n\n“It is never too late to be what you might have been” - George Elliot\n\nSee ya around!"

    "text": "Setting Up\n\nInstall Packages\nWe begin by installing fastbook and duckduckgo_search. The formers allows us to access the fast.ai library that will help us build our image classifier and the latter allows us to access DuckDuckGo search engine features to search, get, and download our images for training.\n\n!pip install -Uqq fastbook duckduckgo_search\n\n\n\nImport Relevant Libraries\nWe import the relevant libraries. More about them here.\n\nfrom duckduckgo_search import ddg_images\nfrom fastcore.all import *\nfrom fastdownload import download_url\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n\n\nSetup A System For Getting Images\nHere, we create a handy little function that can search for a specific term on DuckDuckGo image searches and get its URLs\n\ndef search_images(term, max_images=30):\n    print(f\"Searching for '{term}'\")\n    return L(ddg_images(term, max_results=max_images)).itemgot('image')\n\nFor example, if our term is africa continent map, the above function gets the first popped up URL of the image of africa continent map as shown below.\n\nurls = search_images('africa continent map', max_images=1)\nurls[0]\n\nSearching for 'africa continent map'\n\n\n'https://cdn.onestopmap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/464-map-africa-continent-political-shaded-relief.jpg'\n\n\nOnce, we get the URLs of an image, let us setup a way through which we can actually download the URLs we obtained and view them. We will storing the downloaded files in jpg formats.\nThe following snippets do that for us.\n\ndest = 'africa.jpg'\ndownload_url(urls[0], dest, show_progress=False)\n\nim = Image.open(dest)\nim.to_thumb(256,256)\n\n\n\n\nThe Africa continent looks good. Let us have sneak peak on the remaining 6 continents just to make sure that DuckDuckGo is getting the right images for us.\n\ndownload_url(search_images('antarctica continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'antarctica.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('antarctica.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'antarctica continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('asia continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'asia.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('asia.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'asia continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('australia continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'australia.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('australia.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'australia continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('europe continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'europe.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('europe.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'europe continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('north america continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'north_america.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('north_america.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'north america continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('south america continent map', max_images=1)[0], 'south_america.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('south_america.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'south america continent map'\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything, looks good!\nNow that everything is setup, let us create our classifier.

I thought of a cool name theaeonwanderer, checked out the Quarto guide, and went on to set up my blog. It felt really amazing. I had this personal web space of mine, that I only imagined! I had a platform for myself, a place where I can share stuff.\nI wrote two posts around the fast.ai materials I was learning back then when I started. Shared on the forums, got feedbacks, it was great! In the meantime a lot had happened with my learning journey but one of the things that created a friction for me when it came to blogging was my psychological and emotional barriers. I was thinking(and feeling) too much. There were folks, who were writing highly technical stuff talking about papers and so on! And there I was trying to understand what fine-tuning is, struggling to deploy my model in Lesson 2, and barely grasping the concepts taught in the lessons. I said to myself, that I will focus just on learning and one day, when I am over it, I will start blogging about these higher level stuff. Boy was I so wrong!\nI was thinking who the hell would benefit from this. It seemed all uncool and hence I wasn’t embracing it(quite the opposite of the fast.ai slogan eh?!).\nI remember Jeremy saying the following in Lesson 0:\nAs an irony, this exact blog post is that! I wish I knew back then what I am about to cover in this blog. It took me 6 months to get over my psychological and emotional barriers! A few traces still exists but I will overcome them soon."

    "text": "Rome Wasn’t Built In A Day\nOne of the important pieces of advice I was given by my Professor when I was beginning to learn coding was to complete 200 hours of coding and then think about the intermediate or advanced stuff. It is only after you have done the 200 hours of coding, you will get out of that beginner layman/noob phase. Now, would it be wise to judge yourself while you are at the 2nd hour of coding? No not at all!\nThe same goes with any learning venture. The same goes for blogging. There is always an initial phase where we are all noobs. We are horrible at it! You can not stop then. Instead you must allow yourself to just go through the process. Embrace the falls, embrace the weaknesses, embrace the shitty blog posts! Let a few months pass, let a year pass and you will be better at it!\nAt the start of your blogging journey you must allow yourself to write messy posts. It is only after you have written a certain amount of posts, you will learn to improve in your style of writing as well as the content!\nYouTubers when starting their journeys are often told that their first 50-100 videos will suck! They stick with it! Go and look at the earlier videos of PewDiePie or any other successful YouTuber. Even your favourite bloggers, started from way down. What we see today, is a result of the work they put in consistently. That is how learning happens. We are humans after all!\nRemember the journey of Deep Learning?! Back in the 1950s, we started with what, a simple model of an artificial neuron?! And today we have Chat-GPT4 and Stable Diffusion."

It has the following:\n\nLecture videos\nTextbook chapters\nNBs\nResources\n\nYou immerse yourself in the learning process. You watch the lecture, read the chapter, experiment with code, all that wonderful stuff! Once you have learned something, from the lecture, or the chapter, or through experimenting, and even if that learning is as small as concept or as big as building an NLP model, You teach it! Consider it your job! You have to teach it. It has numerous benefits for you as well for others! For you, among other benefits, it helps you solidify what you have learned and clears the gaps in your understanding. For others who are a few steps behind you on the learning journey, it might help them.\nThe idea is the following:\n\nUse blogging as a medium to enhance your learning, helping yourself and others by teaching or explaining it!\n\nDid you learn about validation set and test set? Teach it! Did you build an image classifier? Show us how you did it! Did you understand the code behind that image classifier you built? Link the previous blog and explain the code! Did you feel stuck in the middle of your lesson and got yourself out of it? Share that experience.\nWhenever you learn anything new, just explain it!\nFor other benefits, refer to the links I share at the end of this blog."

We are in a sense delegating our cognitive tools to AI and dumbing ourselves down. I mean what will be left of us when every possible capability of our minds is transfered to AI. There were times, when we would smirk at the concept of doing mental arithmetics thinking that our mobile phones can do it for us, which they can for sure, very accurately. But we are losing our mental abilities to machines to a point that we can not even use it the way we want.\nTo end on a lighter note, here are a few art to cheer you up!\n\n\nfox walking down the street to a bar on a rainy night holding an umbrella"
