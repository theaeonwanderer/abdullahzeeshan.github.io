## The Aeon Wanderer

The Aeon Wanderer by Abdullah Zeeshan is a hub endeavoring into pursuits that bring challenge, joy, meaning, and purpose to my life. Currently, this pursuit is Data Science, an occasional indulgence in Writing, and hopefully of content creation in the future.

Data Science encapsulates multiple fields. I am currently exploring Deep Learning, Machine learning, and AI. I wish to work on building cool AI systems someday.

On this blog I document my learning journey and explorations in Data Science.

## Writing

Have a peek at my [non-technical blog](https://theaeonwanderer.blogspot.com/) where I document pieces of general writing inspired from my life and others.
