We are living in the times where all art forms that were solely reserved for humans is slowly being generated by AI. Be it the art of writing, music, images, video creation, and even pure art!

2022 began wonderfully with the advent of AI systems that could create art with mere textual descriptions. Platforms like [DALL.E.2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Mindjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), and many more have emerged gaining high popularity across the world. 

I was a little away from the AI buzz news, and I got to know about it a little later when I was listening to [Lesson 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE) of the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course offered by [fast.ai](fast.ai). Jeremy Howard, the instructor of the course shared these amazing explorations done by people who toyed with this new state of the art AI beauty! 

I had to go and explore them myself. I just had to! I mean, just look at these.

So, I signed up of [DALL.E.2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and started to experiment with it. In this blog I am sharing some of my explorations which were mind bending.

## A Challenge I Faced

I had this wonderful machine infront of me, that was waiting for my textual instructions to create art! The first challenge I faced was the inability to express what I wanted to see. I mean, I am a human after all, and I must be really good with the primary skills that I possess as a human, to articulate myself. But, there I was staring blankly at the search bar, thinking what to type. All I could come up with was *"fox eating an ice cream"*, which is a good thing to begin with. It did give me results of "a fox eating an ice cream".

But I couldn't articulate longer descriptive sentences.  I spent some time thinking and grabbing ideas from other peoples search styles and finally I was able to describe something expressive and detailed. Let me show you its wonders.

## A Minor Epiphany

I might be stepping on a slightly contreversial theme here, but on a bit of a different philosophical tangent, I had a minor epiphany that I want to share.

As I was struggling to articulate descriptions of art I wanted see, it crossed my mind that although we are moving towards this amazing world of possibilities where AI can do brilliantly magical stuff, but we as humans are also losing parts of ourselves which were innate to our cognitive abilities. We are in a sense delegating our cognitive tools to AI and dumbing ourselves down. I mean what will be left of us when every possible capability of our minds is transfered to AI. There were times, when we would smirk at the concept of doing mental arithmetics thinking that our mobile phones can do it for us, which they can for sure, very accurately. But we are losing our mental abilities to machines to a point that we can not even use it the way we want. 

To end on a lighter note, here are a few art to cheer you up!
