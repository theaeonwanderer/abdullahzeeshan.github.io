## Introduction

Throughout the chapter 1 of the *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD* textbook, Jeremy and Sylvain mention various themes that will be discussed in the rest of the book. I have tried to grasp these themes and curate a list that I can refer to as I read the next chapters. Along with the Table of Contents, I have found this list quite helpful and have decided to share that here.  

## The List

Following are the things we will explore and learn throughout the book:

1. How the 8 requirements of modelling the human cognitive processes proposed by *Parallel Distributed Processing* (PDP) match with today's neural network
2. How to build Rosenblatt's machine
3. All of the code behind the fast.ai software
4. Much of PyTorch
5. SGD
6. How neural networks and SGD work together
7. The *Universal Approximation Theorem*
8. Approaches to labelling our data
9. Creating a recommendation system
10. Feedback Loops
11. How to create a handwritten digit classifier
12. The methods to avoid overfitting
13. CNNs
14. Various architectures of fast.ai
15. How to create our own architectures
16. ResNet
17. Various metrics provided by fast.ai
18. Tricks to adapt a pre-trained model for a new dataset
19. Other parameters to use with `fine_tune()`
20. Issue and challenge of fully understanding, how a model behaves when encountered with unseen data
21. Segmentation
22. How `fine_tune` works
23. Building a language translation model to translate French and English
24. Create our own image dataset
25. How to use DL models in practice
26. Identification & fixing of errors
27. Creating a real working web-app
28. How to avoid our models causing unexpected harm to our organization and society
29. Foundations of how Deep Learning works
